# Rabuno | Aspiring Software Engineer

Hey there, I’m Rabuno — a junior developer on a journey to becoming a great software engineer. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of programming and building small projects to sharpen my skills. My main focus right now is on mastering C, Java, and HTML as I explore the world of software development.

## What I’m Learning:

- Writing clean and efficient code in C and Java
- Building simple static web pages using HTML
- Understanding core concepts like data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming

## What I’m Working On:

- Practice projects to strengthen my coding fundamentals
- Exploring how to combine HTML with CSS and JavaScript next
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub for version control

This GitHub is my coding playground — feel free to check out my progress!
